I trained the [GPT-2 AI](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) with the abstracts of the Calendars of State Papers, to produce hundreds of 'fake' abstracts, following this [tutorial](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/).

Using the results I built an application which displays two abstracts, one real and one generated by AI, allowing users to vote on which they think is correct. The application keeps a tally of correct results.

The project makes use of Shinyalerts to display a pop-up window with the result of each guess.
