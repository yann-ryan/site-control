summary: This page takes the list of providers for 2 and 8 day corona tests as found [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/providers-of-day-2-and-day-8-coronavirus-testing-for-international-arrivals) and converts it into a simple dashboard. Use the sliders and selecter to filter the table to a preferred range of providers. Made using R, particularly rvest and crosstalk. Brief code tutorial available soon!
