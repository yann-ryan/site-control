I'm a researcher working at the intersection of literary history—specifically early modern news—and data science. This site is a place for my recent publications, some projects and applications I've been working on, as well as some blog posts relating to Digital Humanities, R, and other random topics. 

I'm currently on the lookout for long and short-term projects. As well as academic historical research and consulting on DH projects, I'm interested in visualisation design, and have experience with R, ggplot, Shiny, Python, and teaching DH courses. Feel free to [get in touch](#contact) if you're looking for help with any of the above! 

This site was built using a bunch of open-source tools: R-studio, <a href='https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/'>Blogdown</a> and <a href='https://gohugo.io/'>Hugo</a>, and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
